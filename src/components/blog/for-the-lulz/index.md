# For The Lulz

![](https://assets.slugbyte.com/github/misc/for-the-lulz.png)   

I love to crack my knuckles and smash out ideas into my computer, programming has all ways ben a joy to me. It often feels like a game of puzzles that reward me with new puzzles to explore. In that way, I think of coding as a puzzle game. Like any hard game I get stuck, I sometimes find my head will churn a on a solution to a puzzle with little progress. In these moments I find taking  breaks to be more productive than working. After taking a break I can tackle a problem with a fresh outlook, which is more productive but more importantly more enjoyable. 

One of the key factors of this prescription to reinvigorate my coding is taking a *GOOD* breaks. My definition of a *GOOD* break is one that will take my mind off the troubling puzzle. When I have time I like to go for a walk, enjoy a podcast, read a book, and catch up with far away friends. However, sometimes I just want to clear my head for a few minutes without leaving the computer. Being the [TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface)-geek that I am, over the years I have found countless great ways to spend time in the terminal just for the lulz. The following is a list of some wonderful games and tools that I use to take **GOOD** short breaks on the computer. 

**!YEEEEE playing games to take a break from games, life B soo good!**

## Games
### Text adventures
I have to start with text adventures, because the way I see it text adventures were some of the earliest "for the lulz" software. In the late 1970s university students wrote the first text adventure games on their school mainframes. In between research projects these students were *playing* with their code, writing games. These games were shared, modified, and played by the few hackers that had the curiosity to poke about their shared computers to find these hidden gems.

I use the [frotz](https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/frotz) emulator to  play the following [zmachine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine) games. *frotz* should be available on your systems package manager, ie. apt-get, pacman, brew... 

* [colossal cave adventure](http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-adventure/) was written in 1975. It was part spelunking simulation of the real **[Colossal Cave](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Colossal+Cave+Mountain+Park/@32.0620549,-110.6357057,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x86d668ac8da645bd:0x35a07e7864dd8bb7!8m2!3d32.0620549!4d-110.633517?hl=en)**, and part fantasy puzzle game. Though the game is old and has a very basic UI, It remains fun to play to this day. It might look simple at first glance but I found it to be extremely difficult and rewarding. 
* [Zork 1](https://if.illuminion.de/infocom.html) was written in 1980. You play as a treasure hunter venturing into a dangerous ancient empire in seek of great wealth.
* [Planetfall](https://if.illuminion.de/infocom.html). was written in 1983. Planetfall is a space adventure. You are a lowly ensign on a starship. After sudden explosions on you ship you find your self in an escape pod which crash lands on a nearby planet.

### Rouge-like
Rouge-like games are turn based roll play dungeon crawl games with randomly generated levels. They are highly inspired by tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons. We call them rouge-likes because the first of the kind was named [rouge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)), written in 1980.

These game's should be available using your systems package manager, ie. apt-get, pacman, brew...  

* [nethack](https://nethack.org/) is an extremely dificult rouge-like. Choose from an array of character classes with different skills and play-styles, and begin your descent into a dangerous cave to acquire an amulet for your god. Don't forget to feed your pet :p
