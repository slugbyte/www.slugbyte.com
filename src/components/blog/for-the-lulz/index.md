# For the lulz

![](https://assets.slugbyte.com/github/misc/for-the-lulz.png)   

Programming has always been a plesure for me. I love to crack my kuckles and smash out ideas into my computer. It feels like a game of puzzles that reward me with questions to explore. As I tackle a new question I discover a new one. For me this game has no specific outcome, only many potential paths that could be followed. Though I enjoy programming "as a game" in it of itself sometimes my head will churn a question with little progress. In these moments I find taking breaks to be more productive than working. I find that after taking a good break I can tackle a problem with a fresh outlook, that is more productave but more importantly more enjoyable. 

One of the key factors in this perscription to reinvigorate your coding is taking a GOOD break. When I have time I like to go for a walk, laydown and enjoy a podcast, read from a book, chatch up with far away friends, and so on an so fourth. However, Sometimes I just want to clear my head for a few minutes. Sometimes I dont event want to leave the computer. Being the TUI-geek that I am, over the years I have found countless great ways to spend time in the terminal just for the luls. Here are a few of the wonderful tools I have found that are designed just for that reason. 

Which is to say I think every hacker needs down time and pile of lulz tools to blow off steam during what you might tell your boss is "complie time". Dis here a list of a few o my favorite lulzi command line utilitys.


## Games
### Text adventures
I have to start with text adventures, because the way I see it text adventures were some of the earliest "for the lulz" software. In the late 1970s university students wrote first text adventure games on their school mainframes. In between research projects these students were *playing* with their code, writing games. These games were shared, modified, and played by the few hackers that had the curiousity to poke about their shared mainframe computers to find these hidden gems.

I use the [frotz](https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/frotz) emulator to  play the following [zmachine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine) games.

* [colossal cave adventure](http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-adventure/) was written in 1975. It was part spilunking simulation of the real **Colossal Cave**, and part fantasy puzzle game. Though the game is old and has a very basic UI, I think it remains fun to play to this day. It might look simple at first glance but I found it to be extreemly dificult and rewarding.
