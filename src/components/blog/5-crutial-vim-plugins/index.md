## My top 5 vim plugins 
Vim is an incredibly powerful lightweight text editor, however vim's vim's features lack some of the useablity features most programers have grown acustomed to with modern editors. A good modern text editor should have a plugin manager, a tab completion engine, a thoughful file system navigator, commenting shortcuts, and indent formating shortcuts

### 1) Plugin Manager 
There are countless amazing vim plugins to suit all your hacker neads. From colorschemes to flappybird, you can find pretty much anything you would want. Instalingthem can be done manualy, but why waste the time. [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is easy to setup, configure, and works with both vim and neovim.

### 2) Tab completion engine 
I'm dyslexic and have been known to spell the same word in a number of different ways, But with tab completion I can effortlessly write code and save key strokes. [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe) has been my tab completion engine of choise for years. 

### 3) File system navigation 
Atom, sublime text, and VSCode all have a simular file system navigation bar, that allows you to quickly navigate the contents of your project. [NERD tree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) allows you to quicky navigate directorys and open files to read and edit.  

### 4) Commet Toggeling 
When I'm writoing and debugging code I offen like to select a block of text and toggle commenting it out. [NERD Commenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter) is an easy-peasy comment plugin that will do the trick no matter what language you are using.

### 5) Git Gutter
[Vim-GitGutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter) marks weather lines have been added, modified or removed in the vim gutter. This plugin is more flare than utility, but I never the less find it useful.
