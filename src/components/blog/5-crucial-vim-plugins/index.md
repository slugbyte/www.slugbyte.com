## 5 Crucial Vim Plugins
Vim is an incredibly powerful lightweight text editor. However, Vim's features lack some of the usability features most programmers have grown accustomed to using. A good modern text editor should have a plugin manager, a tab completion engine, a thoughtful file system navigator, simple commenting shortcuts, and git integration.

### 1) Plugin Manager  [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) 
Installing plugins can be done manually, but why waste the time. The vim-plug plugin manager is easy to setup and configure configure, and works with both Vim and NeoVim. From color schemes to flappy bird, vim-plug will help you manage all of your amazing plugins to suit all your hacker needs. 

### 2) Tab completion engine  [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe) 
I'm very dyslexic and heavy depend on tab-completion. [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe) has been my tab completion engine of choice for years. One bonus feature is that it even does file system completion!

### 3) File system navigation [NERD tree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) 
Atom, sublime text, and VSCode all have a similar file system navigation bars that allows you to quickly navigate the contents of your project. [NERD tree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) is simple side pane that allows you to quickly navigate directories and open files to read and edit.  

### 4) Comment Toggling [NERD Commenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter) 
When I'm writing and debugging code I often like to select a block of text and toggle commenting it out. [NERD Commenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter) is an easy-peasy comment plugin that will do the trick no matter what language you are using.

### 5) Git Integration  [Fugitive.Vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
[Fugitive.Vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) is not exaggerating when it claims to be the best git wrapper of all time. Fugitive's genius is the way it enables your to intuitively unlock git's power to time-travel. One example of this is how Fugitive can split your code into two panes with a diff to your unstated changes or another branch. I can't tell you how many times this has helped me through stick situations.
