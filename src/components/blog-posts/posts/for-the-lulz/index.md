# For The Lulz
![](https://assets.slugbyte.com/github/misc/for-the-lulz.png)   

I love to crack my knuckles and smash out ideas into my computer, programming has all ways been a joy to me. It often feels like a set of puzzles that reward me with new puzzles to explore. In that way, I think of coding as a puzzle game. Like any hard game I get stuck, I sometimes find my head will churn a on a solution to a puzzle with little progress. In these moments I find taking breaks to be very productive. After taking a break I can tackle a problem with a fresh outlook that is more productive and more enjoyable. 

One of the key factors of this prescription to reinvigorate my problem solving is taking *GOOD* breaks. My definition of a *GOOD* break is one that will take my mind off the troubling puzzle. When I have the time I like to go for a walk, enjoy a podcast, read a book, or catch up with faraway friends. However, sometimes I just want to clear my head for a few minutes without leaving the computer. Me being the [TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface)-geek that I am, I have found countless great ways to spend time in the terminal just for the lulz. The following is a list of some wonderful games and tools that I use to take **GOOD** short breaks on the computer.  

**!YEEEEE lulz to take a break from HAXHAX lul-wut-fun!**

## Games WutWut
### Text Adventure
In the late 1970s university students started playing with their code by writing games on their school mainframes. These games were shared, modified, and played by the few hackers that had the curiosity to poke about their computers for the lulz. Some of these early computer games took the form of what is now called *text adventure games* or *interactive fiction*.

I use the [frotz](https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/frotz) emulator to play the following [zmachine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine) games. *frotz* should be available on your system's package manager, ie. apt-get, pacman, brew... 

* [Colossal Cave Adventure](http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-adventure/) was written in 1975. It was part spelunking simulation of the real [Colossal Cave](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Colossal+Cave+Mountain+Park/@32.0620549,-110.6357057,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x86d668ac8da645bd:0x35a07e7864dd8bb7!8m2!3d32.0620549!4d-110.633517?hl=en) and part fantasy puzzle game. IT'S EPIC.

* [Zork 1](https://if.illuminion.de/infocom.html) was written in 1980. You play as a treasure hunter venturing into a dangerous ancient empire in seek of great wealth.
* [Planetfall](https://github.com/historicalsource/planetfall/blob/master/COMPILED/planetfall.z3) was written in 1983. Planetfall is a space adventure. You are a lowly ensign on a starship. After explosions on your ship, you find your self in an escape pod which crash lands on a nearby planet.

### Rouge-like
Rouge-like games are turn-based role-play dungeon crawl games with randomly generated levels. They are highly inspired by tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons. Rouge-likes got their name because the first of their kind was named [rouge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)), written in 1980.

These games should be available using your system's package manager, ie. apt-get, pacman, brew...  

* [nethack](https://nethack.org/) is an extremely difficult rouge-like. Choose from an array of character classes with different skills and play-styles, and begin your descent into a dangerous cave to acquire an amulet for your god. Don't forget to feed your pet :p
